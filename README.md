## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart
To get started follow simple steps:

1. **Setting up python environment** Ensure you have a version 3.8 or higher Python environment. Recommendation to create and activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `openAI_env` with your preferred environment name:
    ```
    conda create -n openAI_env python=3.8 -y
    conda activate openAI_env
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `ChatPOC` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:
    ```
    cd ChatPOC
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Set OpenAI API Key:** Create file .env which contains your openAI API keys (ex: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxyyyzzz`) ,at your home folder for ex /Users/dle, otherwise you could put .env file at your root folder and modify the load_env as following:
    ```
    dotenv_path = join(dirname(__file__), '.env')
    load_dotenv(dotenv_path)
    ```
4. **Prepare the knowledge base:** Run the crawler with command and enter website & number of page you wish to scan (for ex: 200)
    ```
    python simpleCrawler.py
    ```
    After that embed & index data by command

    ```
    python prepareVectoDb.py
    ```
    Right now the data is download to `data_ongoing` folder and the embed & index is stored in storage_ongoing. Feel free to modify as desired
